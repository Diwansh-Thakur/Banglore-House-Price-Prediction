# 🏡 Bangalore Home Price Prediction Web App

A **Machine Learning–powered web application** built with **Flask**, designed to predict real estate prices across different locations in **Bangalore** based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
This project combines **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and a **beautiful, modern web interface** for seamless real-time price prediction.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

  - **Python 3.x**
  - **Flask** (Backend Framework)
  - **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** (Frontend)
  - **NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
  - **Pickle** for model serialization

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  The model is trained on Bangalore housing dataset.
2.  It uses key features: `total_sqft`, `bath`, `bhk`, and `location`.
3.  Flask loads the model and column data from the `model/` folder.
4.  The user enters property details, and the backend predicts the estimated home price.
